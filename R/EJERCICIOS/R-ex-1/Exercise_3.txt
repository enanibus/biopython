1. Go to Packages --> Search for "OncoSimulatorR" --> View at the right upper corner the version installed --> 2.4.0

2. Same procedure --> 2.1-3

3. You need to call it (after installing it, of course) by typing: "library(OncoSimulR)"
Once you have done it, you will be able to execute OncoSimulIndiv function directly from the R console

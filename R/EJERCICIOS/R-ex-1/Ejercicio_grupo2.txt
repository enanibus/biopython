###Exercise 1:
#setwd("~/R-ex-1")
#1.1.1:
rm (list = ls())
#1.1.2:
x <- seq (from = 123, to = 297, by = 3.5)
#1.1.3:
summary(x)
#1.2.1: There are several options to do it, but for instance we could do:
-Just double clicking on the .R file
-Paste the code in the RConsole and hit enter
-Open file and run it in the console
-source("sumx".R, echo = T, max.deparse.lenght = 99999)
#1.2.2: File -> Open Script -> Select All -> Ctrl+R
#1.2.3: We were not able to do it from Windows Powershell, it always returns some kind of error.

###Exercise 2:
#We could also have printed the result instead assigning it to a variable.
#2.1:
x <- read.table ("d1.txt", header = TRUE)
x
#2.2:
y <- read.table ("d2.txt", header = TRUE, sep="\t")
y
#2.3:
z <- read.table ("d3.txt", sep = "\t")
z
#2.4:
r <- read.table ("d4.txt", header = TRUE, comment.char="@")
r
#Another alternative command for this last case woul be:
r <- read.table ("d4.txt", header = TRUE, fill = TRUE)
r

###Exercise 3:
#3: source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
#   biocLite("OncoSimulR")
#   install.packages("car")
#3.1: packageVersion("OncoSimulR") -> 2.4.0
Alternatively: Go to Packages --> Search for "OncoSimulR" --> View at the right upper corner the version installed --> 2.4.0
#3.2: packageVersion("car") -> 2.1.3
#3.3: You need to call it (after installing it, of course) by typing: "library(OncoSimulR)"
Once you have done it, you will be able to execute OncoSimulIndiv function directly from the R console

###Exercise 4:
#4.1: Character (0)
#4.2: New help window containing "car::scatter3d" help page/link (no ouput shown in the console)
#4.3: apropos("scatter3d")--> [1] "scatter3d"
help.search("search3d") --> Same output than 2.
#4.4: Yes, apropos() search functions that contain the word "scatter3d" in its name, and because that functions are not loades since we type "library(car)" in section 4.1, they do not appear. 
#4.5: help.search searches base R and all packages that you have installed on your computer, while apropos only searches
base R and the packages you have loaded in the current session.
#4.6: apropos(). Yes, you can miss it if you don't call previously the right package.
#4.7: Yes, using help.search("scatter3d", fields = "alias"), as it searches all that contains part of the word "scatter3d" 

###Exercise 5:
#5.1:
x <- 97
y <- 95
save(x, file = "oneObject.RData")
#5.2: save.image()saves the session in a .RData file (hidden) 

###Exercise 6:
#6.1:
hr <- c (87, 78, 86, 62, 69, 69, 68, 67, 75, 76)
age <- rep(c(11, 63, 40, 47), times = c(3, 2, 4, 1))
#6.2:
hr45 <- hr [(age < 45)]
#6.3:
hr2 <- c (Juan = hr[age==63][1], Ana = hr[age==63][2], Carmen = hr[age==45])
#6.4:
hr2 [c("Juan", "Ana")]
#6.5:
x <- c(age[4], age[5], age[10])
y <- c(hr[4], hr[5], hr[10])
m1 <- cbind (x, y)
rownames(m1) <- c("Juan", "Ana", "Carmen")
colnames(m1) <- c("age", "hr")
m1
#6.6:
m2 <- cbind.data.frame (x, y)
rownames(m2) <- c("Juan", "Ana", "Carmen")
colnames(m2) <- c("age", "hr")
m2
#6.7:
z <- names(hr2)
m3 <- cbind.data.frame (x, y , z)
colnames(m3) <- c("age", "hr", "name")
m3
#6.8:
m1[1,2]
m1["Juan","hr"]
#6.9:
m1["Juan",]
#6.10:
m2["Ana", "hr"]
#6.11:
m3[2,2]
#6.12:
m3[2,]
#6.13:
m3[which(m3[,1]<60),]
#6.14:
m2[which(m2[,1]<60),]
#6.15:
m4 <- cbind (hr, age)
m5 <- m4[which(m4[,2]>15),]
m5
#6.16: No.
#6.17:
sex <- c("M", "F")[c(1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2)]
sex2 <- sex[age>15]
m6 <- cbind (m5, sex2)
m6
#6.18:
sex3 <- c(sex[age==63], sex[age==45])
m7 <- cbind (m2, sex3)m5
colnames(m7) <- c("age", "hr", "sex")
m7

###Exercise 7:
#7.1:
hr <- c (87, 78, 86, 62, 69, 69, 68, 67, 75, 76)
age <- c (rep(11,3), rep(63,2), rep(40,4), 45)
age1 <- sort(age)
hr1 <- hr[order(age)]
hr2 <- c (sort (hr1[1:3]), sort (hr1[4:7]), hr1[8],sort (hr1[9:10]))
m <- cbind (hr2, age1)
colnames(m) <- c("age", "hr")
m1 <- m[which(m[,2]>15),]
m1

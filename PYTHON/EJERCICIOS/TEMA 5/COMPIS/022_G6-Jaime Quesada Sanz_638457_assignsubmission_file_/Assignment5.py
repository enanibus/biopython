###MyGroup_Group 6 (Alejandro Asensio, Marina Gonzalo, MÂªJose Jimenez y Jaime Quesada)
## ASSIGNMENT 5

##INSTRUCTIONS:
#1-Open the terminal and go to python (or python3).
#2-In the command line, write the name of this file first and then the name of the file that you want to read.
#3-Press enter and the result of the translation will be saved in a document with the accession number of the translated protein as title.
